      <p>My name is Jia Wei Fang, in short is "Jia". I have an English name as "Phoebe". But I like my Chinese name better because it's my nature and culture. I like to hike, camp and cook. Hiking and camping are my top two must-do activities in the summer. I am so blessed that I moved to Washington all the way from China and enjoy all of it's beauties, such as nature, mountains, people, culture, and food. Besides working in a startup and being a student at UW bootcamp, my third occupation is housewife chef. I almost cook everyday to fill up my husband's stomach with the creative east-meet-west dishes. At this moment, what I enjoy doing the most are learning to code, making new delicious dishes and exploring the mother nature with my husband.

      I am interested in programming for many reasons. I believe investing myself into the field of technology will be rewarding. Nowadays, technology plays an important role in our daily lives. It has pleasantly surprised us in many ways and brought us so much of convenience and benefits. With the fast growing trend, knowing the basic of programming may become the foundational requirement for any jobs in our next generations to come. So, I want to prepare myself to become a tech mom who can teach my future child to learn programming and inspire them to unearth the unlimited potential of technology.
